I had a quick conversation with the builder today and he mentioned that the septic system is in. They are pushing to pour and strip the frost walls this week and I assume the slab pour is following soon after. We are planning another trip up in a couple of weeks to take a look at progress.

We're looking forward to going up in "peeper" season this year. We have only ever been to Vermont in "peeper" season once and it was gorgeous but completely crowded with peepers (if you don't know, "peepers" is short for "leaf peepers" who are tourists to go to Vermont every fall to watch the leaves change from green to a crazy rainbow of colors).  Seeing our property in full fall glory will be amazing. Also now that we have trimmed the trees back, we will be able to see how visible the mountain views are after the leaves drop.
