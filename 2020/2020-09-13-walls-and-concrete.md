Now that the footers are completed, the next step is to pour the frost walls that run most of the way around the site.  There are some parts of the foundation that use pilings to serve as a basis for a non-slab area that will consist of cedar decking. These areas are, specifically, the walkway between the garage and main house and the floor of the screened porch on the north side of the house. 

The contractors spent the week putting up concrete forms and surveying to make sure everything was laid out to the right height and pin-perfect before they started pouring concrete. From the looks of it, these walls should get poured early in the week, then the forms will be stripped and they start work on the forms for the final concrete slab.

Some of the other critical work that will need to get done during this process is:

- run the water lines beneath the slab to their target locations in the kitchen and bathrooms
- run drain holes from the bathrooms into the slab that then route to the septic tie-ins
- run conduits for the electrical cables and internet cables

These all have to be run to tolerances that are very tight so the architect and the builder have been confirming all of the locations and dimensions of those critical spots this week. 

We also met with the architect to go over window shop drawings, colors for door and window frames, window handles and other critical decisions. Windows currently have at least a twelve week lead time so if we want them done close to Thanksgiving, as we near the completion of the framing and sheathing process, we have to order them this week.
