title: Woodcutting Weekend

This weekend we went up to the land to see how things were doing.  We didn't get to see the slab because it didn't get poured on Friday as we had hoped.  One of my goals for the next few visits was to get some of the vast amounts of logs cut down into firewood so it can start seasoning for next fall. I took the chainsaw, bought a maul
and splitting axe at the True Value in Waterbury on the way up and got ready for some wood cutting. 

Saturday was gorgeous weather and we started work pretty early.  By mid-afternoon we had a fairly good-sized stack of wood and were exhausted but it was a good start. Hopefully the slab gets poured on Monday and framing can get moving.
