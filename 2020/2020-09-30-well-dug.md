Our builder today informed us that the well-diggers showed up and dug the well.  It went fairly quickly and we ended up with a well at 200ft deep and 20gpm.  Finally some good news since the slab pour was called off on Monday due to bad weather after weeks and weeks of drought.  The way it looks currently, we might get the slab poured next Monday with framing soon to follow.  Fingers crossed.
