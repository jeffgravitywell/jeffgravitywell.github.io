title: Framing Starts on the Main House Structure

Framing on the main house has started, now that the rain has let up somewhat and the slab has hardened. You can argue either way that nature conspired against us or with us to get this neat leaf pattern on the slab from a blown leaf. I like the idea of nature intruding in the build in a non-obtrusive way but I'm torn between wanting everything perfect and being ok with a happy accident here or there.

The first wall to get tackled is the kitchen wall on the north side of the house. The roof from the garage will tie into this side of the house so I assume that's why they started tackling that one first. They spent a day laying out the framing plan so I am hoping that the weather cooperates this week and that there's a lot to experience when we arrive this weekend.

They also started digging the trenches for the patio foundation footers.

I found this picture when I was going through the archives.  This is the area that is the current entrance to the driveway and that entire wall of green is where the house is currently being built.
