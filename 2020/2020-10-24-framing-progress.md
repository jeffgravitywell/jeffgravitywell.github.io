We traveled up to Vermont for the weekend.  We met two of the builders on the site and they showed us some of the progress made with framing.  They also talked about the next plans which involves installing the floor system and then framing all of the second floor walls. Once those are in place the massive trusses are going to be put in place to form the roof. 

We are waiting for the concrete company to pour the footers and frost walls for the patios that surround the house and will also be needed to lift the trusses in place with the telehandler.  

The house right now is an interesting mix of feeling small in some areas (the library room is feeling pretty snug now that we see its total area) and large in others (like the main living area with its long angles and soon-to-be-high walls). Everyone tells us that building a house is a series of swings like this for the remainder of the process so I'm not surprised. 

We were going to go do some more woodcutting but it started raining so we're going to do some exploring in the woods instead.

Here is a stick-season view from our bedroom window. Not bad.
