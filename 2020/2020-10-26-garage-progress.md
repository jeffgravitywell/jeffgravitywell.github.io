My biggest worry leaving Vermont on Sunday was that the weather or schedules would conspire to delay some key parts of the build, which would cause a cascade of schedule delays.  Footers don't get poured, so frost walls don't get poured so they can't stand up the south wall so they can't put the roof on and then we're stuck with open trenches and a foot of snow.  Or we lose our spot in line to get footers poured because of an equipment breakdown with the excavation company and the lost spot in line, due to the COVID era we are living in, turns into a weeks long delay which then spirals out into weeks of delay and then its too cold to pour concrete and we're stuck for the winter.

This is, unfortunately, how my brain works. Luckily for me, our builder is a good one. Today, first thing, he sent us a picture of a concrete truck pouring footers in the 36F rainy weather.  I think, from here, we get wall structures built and filled with concrete and then our patios get poured. From there, framing should go quickly up to the roof.  They also got the garage floor poured finally.  I'm not sure if they got the bathroom floor done yet or not.

Speaking of "going up to the roof" the trusses were so long for the upper part of the building, they had to be shipped in two parts with the intention of being assembled onsite. I wish we could be there to see these things being put into place.
