Our excellent neighbor, Chuck, braved the rain to get us a few pictures of today's progress.  One of the big lingering worries from last week is gone with the concrete team pouring the footers and wall on the south and west sides of the house.  I thought we were going to prep for the pour of the concrete patios but the builder said that they weren't going to do those until the spring to reduce the risk of damage.  Makes sense to me.

They also put in the flooring framing so that means that the next day they work (tomorrow?) they can either put up the south and west walls or install the floor sheathing.  Maybe both if we're lucky. The big walls that go from the floor to the large truss structures happen next which will be exciting to see because it will finalize and define the real shape of the house and also dry in the structure.
