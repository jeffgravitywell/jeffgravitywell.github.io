The holidays have brought a lull to construction and snow continues to fall in Stowe.  We are working through approvals as much as we can so that there will be no hangups on our end waiting for us to approve a fixture or wood type.

Speaking of which, the fabricators sent some wood samples for the floor and cabinets in the kitchen.

Our neighbor was able to snap some photos of the framed screened porch area and the fireplace enclosure the other day.

Next week we are going to have our monthly team meeting to discuss approvals and open items and look at what is up next for the build.  I think we are going to finish screened porch framing and get the window bucks completed because the windows and doors are apparently on a boat heading our way with a late January delivery date.
