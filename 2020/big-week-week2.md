title: Big Week - Excavation and Driveway

This week started with us meeting the excavation project manager and our builder at the site. They had marked out the driveway while their large vehicle pilot had moved on to a large bulldozer and was moving huge piles of earth around.  The goal is the build up the back end of the site up to the level we need while working down the areas that are still too high.

The driveway will require us to dig down 4.5 feet which will introduce ledge issues.  Ledge will require either an excavator driver attachment or blasting.  Here's what it looks like:
