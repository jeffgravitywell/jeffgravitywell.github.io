There were some major changes happening to the land over at our property today.  Our builder refers to it as "moving piles of dirt around" and he's right. They added the bulldozer to the ensemble yesterday but today was when it really started doing some major work.

When we left last night, that huge chunk of ledge was a worry but they just bashed it with the excavator bucket for a while and it broke up.  They are carving down 4' from the current level and then will build it up with fill and lots of gravel. The earth they are moving out of that area is heading to the east side where they are making things much higher than they are currently and so that the foundation ends up level. There is tons and tons of dirt to be moved to get that area built up but it was headed in the right direction when we left. 

No word yet on the final house build quote but that hopefully arrives shortly. It will include the concrete quote too, which this sitework leads directly into. If we can get things worked through quickly, it means we can keep things rolling which we really want to do. Hard to believe but August is in a couple of weeks and then its a short run towards the colder weather.
