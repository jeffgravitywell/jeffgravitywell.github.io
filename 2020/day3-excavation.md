More stump burying today and a huge pile of brush was burned as well.  Lots of boulders came out of the ground and were put in a huge pile and more logs were stacked.  Slowly but surely progress is being made. On Monday, the project manager for the excavation company is going to stop by the site and mark out the driveway and other parts of the foundation.  We are also going to see if the "ledge" present is going to interfere with the house layout.
