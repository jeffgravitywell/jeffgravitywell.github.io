This week we are on-site to watch the excavation and clearing get started. Part of the woods had been cleared by the original owner prior to selling and then we had a landscaper and excavator do one round of tree clearing in the early spring. While the original owner chopped things fairly haphazardly and left us with a huge pile of junk to deal with, the latest guy was great and even stacked up the hardwoods for me to chop into firewoood when we move. There is a mix in here including maple and cherry.

So once the trees have been chopped down, we also have to remove the stumps and that's mainly what is going on today and tomorrow.  The results are huge piles of stumps which they'll end up burying somewhere on the property.

They also installed silt-fencing.

After watching that for a few hours, we went to explore Mount Mansfield which is just a few minutes away. It's hard to believe that this will be minutes away from where we'll be living.

We also walked around the land for a while.  We own almost 14 acres so there is a lot of room to explore and find stuff like this tree growing out of this massive rock.
