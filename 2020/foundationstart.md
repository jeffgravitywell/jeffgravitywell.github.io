title: Foam and Foundation Start

We have gotten a few pictures from our builder indicating that the concrete footer layout has started.  He continues to do the foam cutting and the concrete team is onsite. I can't wait until the concrete slabs are poured. Once that gets done, we are going to have a great springboard to things like framing, understanding the height of the floor for things like drainage, views, etc.
