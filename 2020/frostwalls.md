title: A Time for Frost Walls

I had a busy weekend with plenty of driving when I took the trip up to Burlington on Saturday. On Sunday, I drove down for a quick trip to Stowe and then back to PA. It was probably too much driving but ultimately something I need to get used to because, over the next 12 months, we are going to be making this trip a lot.

This week the excavation and concrete teams were working on digging frost walls, prepping foam foundation insulation and roughing out the rest of the concrete footings. Once this is complete we will get the slabs poured so this is actually a big time for the build because, once those slabs are poured, we move straight into framing.

Here are the frost walls from a distance.  This view is mostly the garage section because we are going to have cedar plank decking for the walkway and screened porch sections so we need frost walls in that section.

Here is the massive chunk of ledge beneath the garage section that the excavators were worried about when we were at the site in July.  They brought in a jackhammer excavator to break up this section and it resulted in some huge piles of rock.  We need to figure out what the heck we are doing with those.

Here are the giant stacks of very heavy, thick foam insulation which is going to work as a shield for our shallow foundation areas.

Here is how deep these footings are being dug. If you look at the black line on that stake sticking up (zoom in!), you can see where the floor level is going to end up.
