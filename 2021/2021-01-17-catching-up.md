We had a prolonged break due to a trip for family reasons but we were still receiving sporadic photo drops from people. After the run up to the holidays there was a time of great progress and it looks like, post-holidays, it seems to have continued.  

The screened porch, which comprises the back side of the garage, has been framed and I have to assume the roof line will make contact with the main house forming the covered walkway soon.

Inside, the rockwool insulation that will serve as sound baffling is being cut and inserted and all of the walls upstairs have been framed.

In the past week, they have started roughing in the plumbing and worked towards installation of the Zehnder. The delivery of all of the external doors and windows are arriving via boat sometime this week. It's possible that they could arrive as early as tomorrow but the end of the week is more likely. 

Now that we have moved past pure framing, the checklist of items that are getting worked on is much more varied.  Next week we will be in Vermont to test out the placement of outlets and switches.

* Thanks to Sam for pointing out the batting type! I had it wrong.
