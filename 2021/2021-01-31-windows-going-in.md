title: New Windows Are Installed

The builders have started installing the windows in the house. Everything is going well with the exception of the fact that one of the windows was broken during shipment. The break was curious as it was one of the windows packed between other windows but the builder isn't that worried as they will have new glass sent from the manufacturer in a few weeks and he said it shouldn't hold them up.  Just one pane of the glass was broken and, with two more panes of glass in the window frame, it will hold heat.  This is probably a good thing because the temperature is -15F this morning and 10" of snow is expected over the next couple of days.

The subcontractors are hard at work as well.  Plumbing is going in and wires are being run to all of the rooms. The last I heard there was a wait for the Zehnder unit (a ComfoAir Q450 TR) but they have a lot of work to do before that is setup so we should be OK on that front.

We also signed the contract for our appliances and we plan on ordering light fixtures this week.

On the housing front, it looks like we have a good chance of having a place in May as planned. Waiting for final confirmation from the people who own the apartment we plan on renting.  I want that buttoned up this week if possible, just to get that weight off of my conscience. Then the big worry becomes selling our current house (and finishing the new one!).
