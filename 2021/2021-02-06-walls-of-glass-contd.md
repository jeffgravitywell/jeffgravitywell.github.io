As our latest invoice reflects, the changes over the last few weeks have been massive and encouraging. We are still on target with regards to our scheduling (mid-August completion) and there are a lot of big things happening. The subcontractors doing the HVAC rough-in should get the remaining Zehnder devices and connections this week, the mini-splits are in, the plumbing is all roughed-in and the electrician is finishing up running all of the wires.  

We also had a team meeting yesterday where we did things like confirmed siding and roofing colors, discussed the choice on shou-sugi ban wood that will be installed under the porch roof, discussed the ordering and installation of appliances (which we did last week), and a ton of other things. Our project manager keeps things organized and it is greatly appreciated to have someone with that much attention to detail handling it.

Going unmentioned among all of the activity is that our wood stove/fireplace was installed.  The stovepipe goes up to just under the roof and they won't do the penetration until the roofer is ready (when things thaw).

The front door was installed along with all of the remaining windows.

The only glass that isn't installed is the sliding glass on the south wall but, by and large, the wall of glass that will heat the house is going to be in by Tuesday. What is shocking when in the space that doesn't translate in the photos is the fact that the sliding doors are eight feet high and ten feet wide. It truly feels massive.

Next week (or soon) they will be scheduling the blower door test. Efficiency Vermont, a non-profit based in the state, runs the test and measures the pressure when you pull air through the house. We hope for a very low number which means that there is little-to-no air leakage.  The process is to do the blower door test now and then do it again when all of the insulation is in and the walls are sealed up on the inside.  

Once the first blower door test is completed, all of the rockwool, cellulose and other indoor insulation will be installed and they will begin work attaching the EPS foam to the outside of the structure.
