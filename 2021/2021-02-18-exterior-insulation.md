The last time we went up to Vermont to see the build progress they received a massive delivery of EPS foam insulation for the exterior of the house.  When they received the windows the next day, the insulation went on the back burner for a bit.  Now that all of the exterior windows and doors are installed, the team has turned their attention to the exterior insulation again. This exterior work can continue while the rough-ins for mechanicals, electrical and plumbing (MEPs) are completed.  As these exterior walls get their foil-coated approximately 2-3" thick EPS installed, the house will start on its path to being not only sealed from air leaks, but also start acting like a beer cooler except with the goal of keeping the warm are *in* instead of out.

Alongside of progress on the exterior and the MEPs rough-ins getting done, we are also doing final choices for things like floor finishes, exterior material colors, interior plasterwork contractor choices (and colors and textures for what they will do once they get started), furniture hunting (and buying where we find deep sales) and move planning.  It is getting daunting from our end but I'm sure our builder Colin has it well in hand on his side of things.  So far he's done an amazing job with sourcing materials and keeping things pretty much matching the trajectory laid out for the project back in March 2020. 

Also on our agenda is searching for and applying to pre-schools for our child, getting the lease sorted out for our temporary summer housing, getting moving vehicles sorted and figuring out how we are going to do all of this while also working, picking up a college kid from Champlain on a random weekend in May, selling a car, selling our house and packing. During a pandemic. No problem!
