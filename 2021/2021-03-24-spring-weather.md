We looked at the calendar and noticed that we are speeding through March and apparently the weather has noticed as well, bringing with it temperatures in the 60's to the frigid North. 

The roofer's metal has arrived by truck.  We are third in line on his client list. I'm not sure what that means but it probably indicates that we will have a roof at some point in the future I guess, which is good.

Inside the house, things have slowed, as the builders have moved outside to work on the porches and walkways. The electrician has roughed out all of the wiring which is looking good.  Also this week, Efficiency Vermont came by the build to do some tests, notably the blower door test.  Once the calculations were made and the square footage was figured, it looks like we got a 0.6ACH which is passivehaus level of air-tightness. I was surprised given that we weren't as restrictive as the passivehaus certification is regarding the number of holes we punched into the exterior (Zehnder, range hood, drier, fireplace). Right now, due to the insulation and sealing, the house is currently heated entirely by a space heater placed in the kitchen area even when the temperature was down in the tens.

The rafter work is almost completed. They attached all of the ledgers (see previous post) with gigantic fasteners and now the rafters and porch ceilings are nearly complete.

And the builders are enjoying the 65F weather to finish the porch areas, despite the roaring start to mud season. We learned that one half of our road is basically impassible due to the mud this week as things melt and thaw. Our neighbors have a tractor-support-system in place to pull each other out of the ruts if they get stuck. I plan on being a part of that group as soon as the tractor arrives. The porches look good though.  The silhouette of the house comes into view...
