There was a lot of activity, as anticipated, at the house site this week. The load of ash tongue-and-groove wood that was delivered last week was put to use. The team did a fantastic job of putting it up and the effect, once seen in a big field, is stunning.

The other big thing going forward is the roof work. We were able to slot into the roofer's schedule a few months early so I am very excited to see this happening. I think the color and look of it will be perfect for what we are now calling "Black Metal House". We like black metal, but the house is also clad in black metal so it fits perfectly.
