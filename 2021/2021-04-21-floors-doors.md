The ash ceiling was completed this week and I think it looks fantastic. The black bezels on the overhead lights look great and will echo the black window and door frames in a subtle way once things are done. We also ordered a really cool hanging light fixture from Vermont fabricator Hubbardton Forge. It was expensive but will add a lot of natural shapes to counter the concrete, black aluminum and plaster.

Speaking of plaster, our plaster guy backed out.  We are currently looking for a new subcontractor to do that for us. We have a lead on a new guy, Pierre, but no news yet on if he'll come aboard.  

After a week of acclimatization, the ash wood floors were installed upstairs. They are looking fantastic too. Combine that with the custom doors, which also arrived last week from Stark Mountain Woodworking,  and a good deal of the interior wood work was completed in short order.  This week i think the floors get sanded and two coats of finish applied. After that, I suspect we may be moving on to the white cedar walkway and screen porch. Either that or drywall.  I heard a rumor that the metal cladding might arrive this coming week so thats on the agenda too. I don't think we can start the metal cladding unless the shou-sugi ban porch wood arrives as well since there are a lot of connections and coverings that need to be made between the two materials.

The roof was either completed, or nearly completed this week, although I haven't seen a picture of it because it snowed the other day and it was currently covering the entire roof area. The last picture I saw had both sides of the house done, the garage done and the only remaining piece was the porch.

We have some big weeks coming up. We are making some changes to our current house so we can complete the sale of it, we are getting ready for a quick trip up to Vermont this coming weekend, we are packing and getting rid of furniture we won't need in the new house and we have forty-one days until moving day. I quit my job last week so there's a certain amount of stress there because I want a smooth transition for the sake of my team members. I hope to take some days off here and there so I can concentrate on getting ready for the move.  My wife and I are both vaccinated now which greatly reduces stress for us both and being able to send our kid back to school has been helpful for move prep as well.
