Just a quick update this week.

We have gotten through the paperwork and process on selling our house in PA and we are starting to pack in earnest this week. I don't think it is going to be *too* bad since we already filled two dumpsters worth of junk and most of the furniture will be given away or donated to charity.  There isn't a lot left after all that is done.  Then we have two sections of the truck to load -- the stuff that goes into storage until the house is done and the stuff we'll need in Vermont while we are living in the apartment.  That will take some organizing but it shouldn't be too difficult to pull off. 

The build is now focused on putting the shou sugi ban wood on the exterior under the porch roof. We love the look and it apparently looks incredible in person so we can't wait to see it. Once that is completed (along with the soffits and other exterior wood details), they will start the metal cladding.  They plan on starting that next week.

The dry-wall install started on Friday. That is expected to continue for about 3 weeks due to the taping complication and detail finishing. Completing the dry-wall that will be transformational to the interior look of the house when we next see it. 

We are going back and forth with the builder, the architect and the designer about the finishing of the fireplace surround. We had trouble securing a plaster finisher and thought we might pivot to some interesting industrial steel cladding as an alternative. Recently, however, our builder tracked down another plaster craftsman.  The new craftsman is more expensive -- a lot more expensive -- but I think we are going back to plaster as the finish. The industrial metal idea  wasn't a total loss because we decided on making the plaster a darker gray than we had originally planned.  It's going to look great.

Twenty-one days until I drive the moving truck up to Vermont.
