The builders from Shelterwood finished the shou sugi ban siding on the under-porch area last week. Next week is probably going to be focused on the black metal cladding on the exterior while another crew works on the first floor drywall. The holes are cut and finished for the main garage door installs while the regular-sized side garage door was installed last week as well. They also got a shipment from the metal fabricators which contained the flush-mounted railing hangers and the metal firewood box, ready for painting. 

The light colored wood that joins up to the shou sugi ban is getting painted the same color as the pine pillars. It should be a dark gray stain. The color is picked out but the actual painting is still on the todo list. I believe they want to give the wood more time to dry and acclimatize before doing that.

The kitchen interior cabinets and shelving is supposedly done.  We just have to keep our fingers crossed it all fits when it arrives.

The plan has the garage door installer coming on Monday to get the doors put in place and once that whole structure is enclosed and secure we'll be ready to start moving some things up north.  Moving day is fast approaching. 

The second floor drywall hanging was completed last week and this week should see the first floor completed.  Then the taping and mudding starts which should take a while but that is a huge interior leap forward. I assume we move on to wood trim (more ash) and painting.
