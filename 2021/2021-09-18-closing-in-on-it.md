title: Closing In On Moving In

As I said before, our current plan is to move in on October 1. The house won't be done but it will save us considerable money if we get into the house as early as possible. The things that are likely not going to be done before we move in are:

- Bathroom glass
- Some kitchen pieces
- Punch list items like paint touch ups
- Doors (which might still not all fit perfectly)
- Some lighting fixtures (in various states of shipping)
- Landscaping
- Door thresholds
- Water softener (soonest install was Oct 20)
- Sofas and other shipping items that have massive delays

That said, there were some deliveries and progress this week, albeit slow.  Our builder doesn't want to bring his crew back on site until there is a full slate of work and that probably won't happen until next week.  

One of the big things this week was that our were appliances delivered.

The appliance delivery company was supposed to install the washer and drier but we didn't have water running where it needed to be so our builder's crew will have to install them.  They are in the room which we are calling the "dressing room" so they hopefully won't be too hard to get put in place.  The area is a laundry, closet and place to keep all of the clutter of clothes management in one place so its not really just a "closet" per se. But it serves a bigger function than a laundry.  "Dressing Room" is very grand-sounding and isn't totally accurate but it will have to do for now.

The kitchen appliances are mostly in place.  We left room for the fridge to sit flush allowing for a large plug in the wall but there is also a water filter that goes behind the fridge that pushes it out too far. As a result, the builder is crafting a small recessed box to house the whole filter assembly.

The HVAC team arrived early in the week too.  They hooked up the first and second floor heat pumps and installed the compressors behind the house. The heat pump head units needed room to install a management device so we had to cut some large holes next to each unit for access.  Another mess to clean up.

The photo below neatly encapsulates what we are going for with the aesthetic decisions on the house -- large windows with lots of light and an exploration of how it plays off of the different textures and surfaces.  Plaster on the fireplace wall, ash boards creating "wall" when viewed at one angle and an interesting visual when viewed from another. Ash stairs with a creative, non-standard shape and windows with views into deep woods. Smooth white walls, textured metal railing. We are hoping it all creates a harmonious design and feeling when its all completed.

The end of the week, Thursday, saw the south side patio stairs concrete poured. We have been waiting for this because it joins the patio/porch area outside of the large sliding door with the lower patio outside of the bedroom window. The wood blocking structure was still on Friday afternoon and will remain so for a day or two but the stairs should be fully complete next week.

This coming week should be one of the most pivotal in terms of getting the house move-in ready. We are going to have big things happening that require an all-hands-on-deck approach with the builder and several subcontractors. 

The landscaping should be happening soon, likely next week but it depends on factors like weather and readiness.  They plan on spreading topsoil on the remaining lawn area, excavating the north patio area, removing a tree that was damaged when they put the septic tank in, and installing drip edges on the north and south sides of the house.

The solar installers ran into a permitting issue with Stowe Electric and needed to stop work until the 22nd, Wednesday. Once they return they have 1-2 days worth of work to complete the solar install. 

The countertops, one of the key reasons for all of the delays, arrive on Thursday. They will be installed in the kitchen but there is also a stone bench near the fireplace and the surfaces on the vanities in the bathrooms and the tub on the first floor.  These countertops are holding up things like cabinet installs, tiling, and a host of other things so once they are in place, those other things can cascade to completion, in theory. 

For instance, the kitchen countertops will require a tiled backsplash install that alternates with inset ash shelving. The bathroom shelves, once installed, serve as a substrate for the tall cabinets and inset ash shelving next to the tub. 

Also held up in the wait for the countertops is the plumbing for the fixtures in the kitchen and bathrooms. There are a few things we are waiting on for shipping but the list is dwindling. None of the plumbing is in a waiting state so hopefully they can install it all with no fanfare or drama.  

Lighting on the other hand is experiencing a lot of shipping delays currently.  Hopefully all of the ordered pieces arrive next week and we can get all of the lighting installed. There is still a lot to do on that front. 

Plodding forward...
