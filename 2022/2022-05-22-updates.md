As we run up to the one-year mark for living full time in Vermont, I realized it has been ages since I last posted an update so I thought it would be a good time to run down some specifics on how the house has handled situations over the last few months.

By way of an overview, the house performed very well overall and has been comfortable with a few exceptions. Winter, which was always a worry since we've spent most of our lives in lower latitudes, was actually pleasant and, as the temperature creeps into the high eighties, I miss it already. We didn't get to ski as much as we would have liked but it was still a learning year for us and many weeks saw us spending time getting settled in some way. I am looking forward to going skiing much more next year. 

### WINTER

The house handled temperatures from the mid-30's down to -15F or so pretty easily.  Once things dipped into the -20 to -30F range, the results were mixed but I suppose you could say that for practically any house.  Those temperatures are pretty extreme and also, thankfully, rare. There was just one night of -30F all winter long. It was a good learning experience and we took steps to help the situation out when it happens again next winter. It is important to not overbuild a house taking into consideration the extremes alone.  For the common temperatures found during the winter here, the house was well-suited to the task.  

The Efficiency Vermont write-up mentioned in the last post arrived in the intervening weeks of April and had some technical data in there about house efficiency and heat loss.  If there are any numbers you are interested in, let me know via email and I'll update things accordingly. I appreciate their thoroughness during the design, build and post-build processes and we are lucky to have them here in Vermont. Their changes are all reflected in the end product and I think we're probably feeling the results of them on a daily basis.

Solar was first commissioned in mid-October so there was next-to-no time to build electricity credits for the winter.  While I could whine about this at length because I wanted the solar installed in July when it was first scheduled, it does provide a pretty clear picture of how much actual electricty we would pay in the absence of solar panels because there was very little energy generated by the panels from November to March. Sure, there was some, but our winter had many weeks of gloom and grey skies. The offset was minimal. 

Here are the rough electrical bill costs for the winter months.

November: $75
December: $125
January: $279
February: $463
March: $282
April: $127
May: $19
June: $49
July: $19

Of note in those numbers is that January and February had average temperatures that were among the lowest on record for Vermont. There were long stretches of temperatures below -12 to -20F in the evenings and 0F during the day. Also of note is that it is our only energy bill, and aside from our fiber internet, our only monthly house-related bill to speak of.  As I write this, the solar panels on a partly cloudy day have generated 42.2kWh of production. They are generating between 294kWh and 464kWh weekly but the days are still getting longer and the sunny days are coming so I suspect we'll be banking a significant amount of credits for the winter which, given the world's energy prices lately, I can only view as a good thing. I am very curious if our summer production will get us to net-zero for the next 12 months.  

There were a few problem areas that can be mentioned more in-depth to help give an understanding of how the various systems interacted with the climate, both indoor and outdoor and where things might be improved. 

First, the energy saving water heater extracts heat out of the surrounding air and converts it to heat to warm the water.  This is great in summer, but in winter, when you are struggling to heat the house, having the water heater act as an air conditioner isn't helpful.  You can over ride this function, turning it into a standard electric water heater temporarily, but the setting doesn't "stick" and would go back to energy-saver mode after a time.  Our plan for next year is to put a small space heater in the mechanical room which kicks on at 50F and it can battle with the water heater. It happens so infrequently, I don't think it will drastically affect energy usage. 

The garage roof was a place where we talked about adding a snow-stopper but we held off to see how our first winter went.  After living through the winter with an 8' high snow pile next to the garage, I think it makes sense to add a snow-stopper to keep the snow up on the roof as it melts and prevents damage from falling snow or overwhelming snow piles on the north side of the house. 

Another area that caused problems when the temperature is -30F is the large sliding door in the living room. We are going to put a space heater in the corner near that window when the temperature nose-dives.  It should help out just enough to make it through the coldest nights.  Once the sun comes up, as it often does when the temperature is that low, the ambient heating does its work.  We can also build a fire during the day. We would go to bed with the temperature at our standard 68F (where we are most comfortable) and wake up to 65F which is a little under our comfort zone. Using the space heater in the main room near that sliding door will probably be enough to hold the heat steady overnight and, if the day is sunny the solar gain will quickly raise the heat in the main room and, if it is cloudy, a fire in the fireplace is probably a good plan. 

Speaking of fire, one of the the remaining  places that needs improvement for winter is the fireplace air intake. Right now it is an open duct that goes right into the firebox. Usually this isn't a huge issue but when its brutally cold, the air mixes with the warm air in the living room and the condensation forms a solid block of ice under the fireplace itself.  As the ice melts, it seems into and stains the plaster. Plus who wants ice in their living room?  Our solution is to put a baffle in the air intake that can be shut when its not in use. Hopefully that happens in the next few weeks. 

### SPRING

There are a few areas in our landscaping that collect water where they shouldn't.  We are going to have to solve those issues over the next few months.  There is no huge rush as the water dissapates after a few hours but it isn't good to have standing water so close to the house and I'd like them resolved.  

We bought and planted six fruit trees and three blueberry bushes last weekend so that's part of the realisation of a dream we've had for years.  I hope they all survive but, as of this writing, they all appear to be acclimating to their new home.

### SYSTEMS

The systems like the Zehnder and the heat pumps have done well.  One of the biggest issues and sources of stress is the fact that there was no drain planned for in the mechanical room. That, combined with the fact that there is a small condensation pump in the room that carries condensation from the heat pumps and water heater, has resulted in water overflowing that small pump into the main mechanical room on two occasions. Both times were due to a clogged line which was easily remedied but the stress of having a water issue at a random time isn't great.  I put a small leak warning device in there next to the pump which will beep loudly and message my phone in the case of water presence so I hope that goes some way to easing my mind. 

The fiber internet, provided by Stowe Cable, has been nearly flawless even on the worst weather days. Consistent 95/95 speeds and no blips in service to speak of. We feel very lucky about that.

### OVERALL 

Overall, the house has been doing pretty well.  Summer heat tends to collect first in the office which is a challenge since that's where a lot of the daytime hours are spent. That said, the house stays in the low 70s until the evening.  I have been running the heat pumps to get the heat down to 71F by the end of the night and then the heat can build again during the next day.  That said, it has been pleasant to open the windows (the ones with screens anyway) and let the air flow through the house when we can.

We got the porch painted black now that the wood has sufficiently dried. I like it.  It helps make the posts recede into the forest when you look our the windows and should be fairly easy to maintain in the future.

This summer in Vermont has been near-perfect weather-wise.  I realize it will be heating up sooner or later but so far, I couldn't have asked for a better, more temperate place to be.
